# Authentication

All API requests require authentication using your workspace keys.

## Key Types

DEPL uses two types of keys for different operations:

### API Key (api_key)
- **Purpose**: Create deep links (write operations)
- **Usage**: Server-side only
- **Security**: Keep this secret, never expose in client code

### Client Key (client_key)
- **Purpose**: Retrieve deep link data (read operations)
- **Usage**: Can be used in mobile apps
- **Security**: Safe to embed in mobile applications

## Finding Your Keys

You can find both keys in your workspace settings:

1. Go to **Dashboard** → **Your Workspace** → **Settings**
2. Copy your **API Key** for creating deep links
3. Copy your **Client Key** for retrieving deep link data

## Using Your Keys

Include the appropriate key in the `Authorization` header:

### Creating Deep Links (API Key)

```bash
curl https://depl.link/api/deeplink \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "slug": "summer-sale",
    "app_params": {
      "screen": "promo",
      "promo_id": "summer"
    }
  }'
```

### Retrieving Deep Links (Client Key)

```bash
curl "https://depl.link/api/deeplink?short_code=abc123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CLIENT_KEY"
```

## Security Best Practices

- **Never** expose your API key in client-side code
- Use API Key only on your backend servers
- Client Key can be safely used in mobile apps
- Store keys in environment variables
- Rotate your keys regularly if compromised
- Use different workspaces for development and production
