# Authentication

All API requests require authentication using your API key.

## API Keys

You can find your API key in your workspace settings:

1. Go to **Dashboard** → **Your Workspace**
2. Copy your **API Key**

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of all requests:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Example Request

```bash
curl https://api.depl.link/v1/deeplinks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Security Best Practices

- **Never** expose your API key in client-side code
- Use environment variables to store your API key
- Rotate your API key regularly
- Use different API keys for development and production
